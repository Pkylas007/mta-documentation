= Analyzing applications with {ProductShortName} CLI

:context: analyzing-applications-mta-cli

Depending on your scenario, you can use the {ProductFullName} {CLINameTitle} to run the analysis the following ways:

* Run the analysis against a single application.
* Run the analysis against multiple applications:
** In {ProductShortName} versions earlier than 7.1.0, you can enter a series of `--analyze` commands, each against an application and each generating a separate report. For more information, see xref:mta-cli-run-single-app_cli-guide[Running the {ProductShortName} {CLINameTitle} against an application].
** In {ProductShortName} 7.1.0 and later, you can use the `--bulk` option to analyze multiple applications at once and generate a single report. Note that this feature is a Developer Preview feature only. For more information, see xref:mta-cli-run-multiple-apps_cli-guide[Running the {ProductShortName} {CLINameTitle} against multiple applications and generating a single report (Developer Preview)].

IMPORTANT: Starting from {ProductShortName} 7.2.0, you can run the application analysis in the containerless mode. Note that this option is set by default and is used automatically if all requirements are met. For more information, see xref:running-the-containerless-mta-cli_cli-guide[Running the containerless CLI].
