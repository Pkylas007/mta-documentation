= Analyzing applications written in languages other than Java with {ProductShortName} command-line interface

:context: analyzing-nonjava-applications

Starting from {ProductFullName} version 7.1.0, you can run the application analysis on applications written in languages other than Java. You can perform the analysis either of the following ways:

* Select a supported language provider to run the analysis for. 	
* Overwrite the existing supported language provider with your own unsupported language provider, and then run the analysis on it.
 

IMPORTANT: Analyzing applications written in languages other than Java is only possible in container mode. You can use the containerless CLI only for Java applications. For more information, see xref:running-the-containerless-mta-cli_analyzing-applications-mta-cli[Analyzing an application in containerless mode].
