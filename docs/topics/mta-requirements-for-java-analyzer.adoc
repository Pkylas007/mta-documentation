[id="mta-requirements-for-java-analyzer_{context}"]
= Adding minimum requirements for Java analyzer and discovery

There is a minimum required for the Java analyzer, and as a result, the  discovery task.

The suggested requirement is a default minimum of 2 GiB. 

The minimum requirement can be lowered to  1.5 GiB. However, this minimum requirement is not recommended. 

This minimum requirement can be set in `provider_java_container_limits_memory` and `provider_java_container_requests_memory` options in the Tackle custom resource.
