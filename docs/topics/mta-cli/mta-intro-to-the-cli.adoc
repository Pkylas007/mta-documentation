= Introduction to the {ProductShortName} command-line interface

By using the {ProductFullName} command-line interface (CLI), you can assess and prioritize migration and modernization efforts for Java applications. {ProductShortName} provides a comprehensive set of rules to assess the suitability of your applications for containerization and deployment on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP).

In {ProductName} 7.1 and later, you can also use the {ProductShortName} CLI to analyze applications written in languages other than Java. The CLI provides numerous reports that highlight the analysis without using the other tools. You can use the CLI to customize {ProductShortName} analysis options or integrate with external automation tools.
