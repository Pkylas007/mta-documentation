= Assessing an application

The assessment process for applications that are to be migrated in {ProductFullName} has been separated from other features. In the {ProductShortName} user interface, you can assess an application and display the currently saved assessments by using the Assessment module.

The {ProductShortName} assesses applications according to a set of questions relevant to the application, such as dependencies.
