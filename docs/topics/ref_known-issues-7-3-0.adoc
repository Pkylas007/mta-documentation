.Application analysis fails to get a list of dependencies for Node.js in the {ProductShortName} UI

When you run an application analysis for the Node.js language provider by using the {ProductShortName} user-interface (UI), the analysis completes with the following error is displayed in the analysis log:

----
level=error msg="failed to get list of dependencies for provider" error="dependency provider path not set" provider=nodejs'
----

To work around this issue, set the `Analysis Mode` setting to `source-only`. 

NOTE: The Node.js provider does not have a dependency capability. Therefore, a dependency list cannot be generated. The same applies for the Python provider.
