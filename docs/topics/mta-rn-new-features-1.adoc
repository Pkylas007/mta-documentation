= New features and improvements

This section describes the new features and improvements of the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {ProductVersion}.

.{ProductShortName} no longer requires support for RWX volumes
Previously, {ProductShortName} required support for RWX volumes, and in version {ProductVersion} this is optional. The Tackle CR includes a new configuration option, `rwx_supported`, a Boolean parameter whose default is `true`.

* When this option is set to `true`, the {ProductShortName} Operator creates a cache volume as RWX. This volume is used by Maven as a durable local m2 cache that is shared across tasks.
* When it is set to `false`, the Maven m2 cache will be local with each task. You can always configure the Maven cache separately.
