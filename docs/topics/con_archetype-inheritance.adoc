= Archetype inheritance

[role="_abstract"]
Inheritance, which is the default setting, means that all applications associated with the archetype inherit the _assessment_ and _review_ from the archetype groups to which these applications belong. However, you can override inheritance for the application by completing an individual assessment and review.
