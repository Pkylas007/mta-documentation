. Select the desired file and click *Open*.
. Optional: Select *Enable automatic creation of missing entities*. This option is selected by default.
. Verify that the import has completed and check the number of accepted or rejected rows.
. Review the imported applications by clicking the arrow to the left of the checkbox.

IMPORTANT: Accepted rows might not match the number of applications in the Application inventory list because some rows are dependencies. To verify, check the *Record Type* column of the CSV file for applications defined as `1` and dependencies defined as `2`.
