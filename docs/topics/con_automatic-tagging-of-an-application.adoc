= Automatic tagging

[role="_abstract"]

{ProductShortName} can automatically add tags to the application based on the application analysis. Automatic tagging is especially useful when dealing with large portfolios of applications.

Automatic tagging of applications is enabled by default. You can disable automatic tagging by deselecting the *Enable automated tagging* checkbox in the *Advanced* section of the *Analysis configuration* wizard.

NOTE: To tag an application automatically, make sure that the *Enable automated tagging* checkbox is selected _before_ you run an application analysis.
