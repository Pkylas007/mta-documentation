This section provides highlighted known issues in {ProductFullName} version 7.0.3:


.The `Applications` page loads slowly when there are many applications

When the Application Inventory has to list many applications, the page loads slowly. Currently, there is no workaround available. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2497[(MTA-2497)]

.Failure to run analysis on a directory of multiple applications

{ProductShortName} 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 fail to run analysis on a directory of multiple applications. The cause of this failure is that the analyzer is expecting a `pom.xml` file in the root directory. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2765[(MTA-2765)]
