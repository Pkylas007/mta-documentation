= Archetype assessment

[role="_abstract"]
An archetype is considered assessed when all required questionnaires have been answered.

An archetype is considered reviewed when it has been reviewed once even if multiple questionnaires have been marked as required.

If an application is associated with archetypes, this application is considered assessed when all associated archetypes have been assessed.
