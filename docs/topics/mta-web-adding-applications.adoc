You can add a new application to the *Application Inventory* for subsequent assessment and analysis.

[TIP]

Before creating an application, set up business services, check tags and tag categories, and create additions as needed.

* You are logged in to an {ProductShortName} server.

.Procedure

. In the *Migration* view, click *Application Inventory*.
. Click *Create new*.
. Under *Basic information*, enter the following fields:
* *Name*: A unique name for the new application.  
* *Description*: A short description of the application (optional).
* *Business service*: A purpose of the application (optional).
* *Manual tags*: Software tags that characterize the application (optional, one or more).
* *Owner*: A registered software owner from the drop-down list (optional). 
* *Contributors*: Contributors from the drop-down list (optional, one or more).
* *Comments*: Relevant comments on the application (optional).

* *Repository type*: *Git* or *Subversion*.
* *Source repository*: A URL of the repository where the software code is saved.
* *Branch*: An application code branch in the repository (optional).
* *Root path*: A root path inside the repository for the target application (optional).

+ 
NOTE: If you enter any value in either the Branch or Root path fields, the Source repository field becomes mandatory.

// ![](/Tackle2/AddingApps/NewAppBinary.png)
* *Group*: The Maven group for the application artifact.
* *Artifact*: The Maven artifact for the application. 
* *Version*: A software version of the application.
* *Packaging*: The packaging for the application artifact, for example, `JAR`, `WAR`, or `EAR`.

+ 
NOTE: If you enter any value in any of the Binary section fields, all fields automatically become mandatory. 

. Click *Create*. The new application appears in the list of defined applications.

.Automated Tasks

After adding a new application to the *Application Inventory*, you can set your cursor to hover over the application name to see the automated tasks spawned by adding the application. The language discovery task identifies the programming languages in the application. The technology discovery task identifies specific technologies in the application. The tasks automatically add appropriate tags to the application, reducing the effort involved in manually assigning tags to the application. After these tasks are complete, the number of tags added to the application will appear under the *Tags* column. To view the tags:

. Click on the application's row entry. A side pane opens. 
. Click the *Tags* tab. The tags attached to the application are displayed.

You can add additional tags manually as needed. When MTA analyzes the application, it can add additional tags to the application automatically.
