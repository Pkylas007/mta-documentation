=== Running the CLI

You can run the {ProductFullName} {CLINameTitle} against one or more applications.

Before {ProductShortName} 7.1.0, if you wanted to run the {CLINameTitle} against multiple applications, you ran a series of `--analyze` commands, each against an application, and each generating a separate report. This option, which is still fully supported, is described in xref:mta-cli-run-single-app_cli-guide[Running the {ProductShortName} {CLINameTitle} against an application].

In {ProductShortName} 7.1.0 and later, you can run the {CLINameTitle} against multiple applications by using the `--bulk` option, to generate a single report. This option, which is presented as a Developer Preview, is described in xref:mta-cli-run-multiple-apps_cli-guide[Running the {ProductShortName} {CLINameTitle} against multiple applications and generating a single report (Developer Preview)].
